Terminal Temperature Converter
==============================

This is my first Rust project---a simple terminal temperature converter. This project allowed me to learn several fundamental aspects of Rust, including:

-   Getting input from the user
-   Using if statements
-   Performing mathematical operations
-   Handling mutable variables
-   Formatting input
-   Using packages
-   Converting from strings to integers

It was a fun and educational small project that enabled a lot of learning. I'm excited to learn more Rust and dive into lower-level programming.

Features
--------

-   Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
-   Input validation to ensure correct data types are used.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

In this project, I learned:

-   How to get input in Rust.
-   How to use if statements for conditional logic.
-   How to perform mathematical operations.
-   How to work with mutable variables.
-   How to format input and output.
-   How to use external packages in Rust.
-   How to convert strings to integers and vice versa.

Usage
-----

1.  Clone the repository:

    sh

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-temperature-converter.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    sh

    Copy code

    `cd terminal-temperature-converter`

3.  Run the program:

    sh

    Copy code

    `cargo run`

4.  Follow the prompts to convert temperatures.

Future Improvements
-------------------

-   Add more unit conversion options (e.g., Kelvin).
-   Improve input validation and error handling.
-   Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
