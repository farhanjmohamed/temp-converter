# Terminal Temperature Converter

This is my first Rust projectâ€”a simple terminal temperature converter. This project allowed me to learn several fundamental aspects of Rust, including:

- Getting input from the user
- Using if statements
- Performing mathematical operations
- Handling mutable variables
- Formatting input
- Using packages
- Converting from strings to integers

It was a fun and educational small project that enabled a lot of learning. I'm excited to learn more Rust and dive into lower-level programming.

## Features

- Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Input validation to ensure correct data types are used.

## Learning Outcomes

In this project, I learned:
- How to get input in Rust.
- How to use if statements for conditional logic.
- How to perform mathematical operations.
- How to work with mutable variables.
- How to format input and output.
- How to use external packages in Rust.
- How to convert strings to integers and vice versa.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-temperature-converter.git
